# Tree-sitter log

A tree sitter grammar that's try to be general enought to work through most log files. Mainly inspired by the [VSCode extension] and [this repo].

- https://github.com/emilast/vscode-logfile-highlighter/blob/master/syntaxes/log.tmLanguage
The most important file is the grammar.js, almost all the rest is generated by the `tree-sitter` commmand line tool.


Helix require only "ui.selection" to be defined, the rest of the tag are dynamically loaded:

Some extract check are done in xtask but they don't seems to be tree-sitter related:

TODO: 
- url highlight
- CI
- ask if they want to add "debug" to theme as we already have info warn err
